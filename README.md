# pypingsweep
A Python ping sweep script to be run on Unix systems. Does not require any input.

Starts by pinging an unimportant address to collect your IP, then it begins the sweep.

Results are saved to the addresses.log file.

This program will only successfully sweep /24 networks but can be adjusted to scan others.
